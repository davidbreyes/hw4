Computational Practices Homework 4
1) There are about 38 lines in the draw function and the for loop runs everytime the mouse is hovering in the code.
2) The first "10" is the start of the code and the second "10" is the end. The third "10" is in charge of how many lines loop in the for statement.

Practice with Arrays Answers
1) The loop runs as many times as the mouse hovers the code.
2) One way of increasing the spacing between the rings is by changing the increment in the for function to a bigger number than 10. Another way is by changing the condition in the for function.
3) The ellipse trail can be made longer by adding a large value in the x and y var functions and changing the increment into a larger value.
